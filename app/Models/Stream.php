         * Issue: 
         * 1. Because viewers come and go during a stream, itâ€™s possible to find duplicate or missing streams in the list as you page through the results
         * 2. We are trying to get 1000 records, but we can only get 100 max at a time
         * 
         * Impact:
         * If we have to make 10 calls to get 100 records each, depending on the time lapse in between, there's a chance that:
         * 1. Duplicates will exist in between calls
         * 2. We might miss the "latest stream with the highest viewers" when we're calling for pages after page 1
         * 
         * Fix:
         * 1. Until we can get an API to get all 1000 at a time, we may have to just ensure that the time lapse between each call is near 0
         * 2. We could leverage Swoole to make the 10 calls concurrently (near instant)
